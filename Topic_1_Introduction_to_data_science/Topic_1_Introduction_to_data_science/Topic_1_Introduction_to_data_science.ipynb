    "## The Six Phases [2]\n",
    "Here is a brief overview of the main phases of the Data Analytics Lifecycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1â€”Discovery:** In Phase 1, the team learns the business domain, including attempted similar projects in the past from which they can learn. The team assesses the resources available to support the project in terms of people, technology, time, and data. Important activities in this phase include framing the business problem as an analytics challenge that can be addressed in subsequent phases and formulating initial hypotheses to test and begin learning the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2â€”Data preparation:** Phase 2 the team works with data and perform analytics for the duration of the project. The team needs to execute extract, load, and transform (ELT) or extract, transform and load (ETL) to get data into the sandbox. The ELT and ETL are sometimes abbreviated as ETLT. Data should be transformed in the ETLT process so the team can work with it and analyze it. In this phase, the team also needs to familiarize itself with the data thoroughly and take steps to condition the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 3â€”Model planning:** Phase 3 is model planning, where the team determines the methods, techniques, and workflow it intends to follow for the subsequent model building phase. The team explores the data to learn about the relationships between variables and subsequently selects key variables and the most suitable models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 4â€”Model building:** In Phase 4, the team develops datasets for testing, training, and production purposes. In addition, in this phase the team builds and executes models based on the work done in the model planning phase. The team also considers whether its existing tools will suffice for running the models, or if it will need a more robust environment for executing models and workflows (for example, fast hardware and parallel processing, if applicable).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 5â€”Communicate results:** In Phase 5, the team, in collaboration with major stakeholders, determines if the results of the project are a success or a failure based on the criteria developed in Phase 1. The team should identify key findings, quantify the business value, and develop a narrative to summarize and convey findings to stakeholders.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 6â€”Operationalize:** In Phase 6, the team delivers final reports, briefings, code, and technical documents. In addition, the team may run a pilot project to implement the models in a production environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once team members have run models and produced findings, it is critical to frame these results in a way that is tailored to the audience that engaged the team. Moreover, it is critical to frame the results of the work in a manner that demonstrates clear value. If the team performs a technically accurate analysis but fails to translate the results into a language that resonates with the audience, people will not see the value, and much of the time and effort on the project will have been wasted."
